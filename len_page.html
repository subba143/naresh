<h1>
    The len() function in Python is a built-in function used to determine the number of elements in a data structure or the length of a sequence
</h1>
<p>
    Usage:

len() is called as a function, followed by an object (or expression) inside the parentheses.
It returns an integer value representing the length of the object.
Objects Accepted:

len() can accept various types of objects, including:
Sequences: Such as strings, lists, tuples, and ranges.
Collections: Such as dictionaries, sets, and other iterable objects.
Behavior for Different Types:

For sequences (like strings, lists, tuples, and ranges), len() returns the number of elements in the sequence.
For collections (like dictionaries, sets, and other iterable objects), len() returns the number of items in the collection.
