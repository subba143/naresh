<h3>In Python, when you access informatics[3], you are essentially trying to retrieve the element at the index 3 in the string "informatics". However, since Python uses zero-based indexing, the first character of a string is at index 0, the second character at index 1, and so forth.</h3>
<h1>EXPLANATION and CODE</h1>
<p>
Let's consider the string "informatics":

  index:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
  string:  i  n  f  o  r  m  a  t  i  c  s
So, informatics[3] would correspond to the character at index 3, which is "o".

Here's sample Python program:

<h2>PYTHON CODE</h2>
Informatics = "informatics"
Pharacter_at_index_3 = Informatics[3]
print(character_at_index_3)
<br>
This would output:
    <b>o</b>
Because "o" is the character at index 3 in the string "informatics".
